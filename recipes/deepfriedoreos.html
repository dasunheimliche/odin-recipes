    <h2>Descripción</h2>
    <p>This is a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried - yummy!! You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredientes</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cookies into the batter one at a time, and carefully place into the hot frying oil. Fry only 4 or 5 at a time to avoid overcrowding the deep fryer. Cook until the cookies are golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
    </ol>
